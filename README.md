# Next.js Business Website Template

This website was created as a hands-on project to try out Next.js (App Router) and modern web development best practices. It serves as a template for my future business and portfolio websites.

## Features

- Built with Next.js App Router and TypeScript
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Shared navigation bar and footer on all pages
- Accessible dropdown menus for About and Products (keyboard and mouse support)
- Animated product carousel on the home page
- Dedicated pages: Home, About, Products, Blog, Contact
- Each product has its own detail page, with data managed in a separate file
- Blog system with dynamic routing and blog data in a single file
- Optimized images using Next.js `<Image />`
- Clean, DRY, and accessible code structure
- Easy to extend for future projects
